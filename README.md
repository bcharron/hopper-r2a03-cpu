This is a plugin for Hopper (hopperapp.com) to disassemble the Ricoh 2A03 (a
MOS 6502). As it turns out, the instruction set is not different from the 6502,
so this plugin can be used for a 6502 too.

It is not able to switch banks yet. Not sure how to approach it.

Code is still a bit rough, but it seems to give the correct disassembly so far.
